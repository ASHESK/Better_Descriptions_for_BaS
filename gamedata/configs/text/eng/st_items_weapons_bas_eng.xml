			Gerber Tomahawk was developed by the famous American outdoor equipment manufacturer Gerber. It was positioned as a lightweight multifunctional tool for defense, infiltration and evacuation. Gerber Tomahawk is made of a solid steel plate with a full tang construction. Its handle is shaped like a crowbar, which, combined with the gap in the blade for the hand grip, makes it an effective lever. Gerber Tomahawk’s butt is enforced and made in a way for it to be comfortably used as an axe and a hammer.\n

			The most widely known variant, the Makarov PMM was a redesign of the original gun. In 1990 a group of engineers reworked the original Makarov, primarily by increasing the load for the cartridge. The result is 25% more gas pressure increasing in muzzle velocity. The PMM magazine holds 12 rounds, compared to the PM's 8 rounds.\n

			The PB (Pistolet Besshumnyj or Silent Pistol), also known in the Soviet army as 6P9, has been developed in 1967 for Spetsnaz units of the Soviet Army, as well as for KGB operatives. The pistol is based on a modified Makarov PM pistol and features an unique integral two part suppressor. Issued into service in 1967, the PB (GRAU index 6P9) is a Soviet silenced pistol based on the Makarov PM. It was intended for use by the KGB and army reconnaissance groups. The front part of the suppressor is detachable, so that the pistol can be broken down into two parts for convenient carry. The PB's integral suppressor also reduces the bullet velocity to below subsonic levels.\n

			The Five-seveN is a delayed blowback operated, semi-automatic firearm. The Five-seveN pistol was designed by FN Herstal as a complimentary sidearm for the P90 submachine gun. The P90 and Five-seveN share the same ammunition, the 5.7x28mm SS190 cartridge. The idea behind the ammunition and weapon is to provide good penetration against targets protected by body armour, while keeping the weapon's weight, dimensions and recoil at reasonable levels.\n

			Developed in Israel by Command Arms and Acessories (CAA), the AK-Alpha assault rifle was first presented to the public in 2016. This weapon is marketed under two brands - "Kalashnikov USA" and "Kalashnikov Israel". Apparently, this weapon found its way into the Zone with the ISG research group. The AK-Alpha assault rifle is an attempt to improve the ergonomics of the AK rifle while maintaining its main advantages - high reliability and ease of maintenance. The AK-Alpha is based on the Russian-made Saiga carbine, reusing its receiver, the barrel with the gas tube, the bolt group and the main components of the trigger.\n

The standard individual weapon for the British armed forces, the L85 (in its original A1 version) had numerous performance issues. The A2 variant came to be as the result of a significant upgrade in the early 2000s by Heckler & Koch and remains in service as of 2020.

			Colt M4A1 - an assault rifle (carbine), designed in the USA on the basis of AR-15 platform for 5.56x45 NATO cartridge. It was developed primarily for use by vehicle operators and fireteams, who required a more compact and lighter weapon than a standard full-length rifle, but using the same ordnance. However, US SOCOM (United States Special Operations Command) was soon to adopt the M4A1 for all subordinate units, followed by general introduction of M4A1 into service in the US Army and Marine Corps.\n

			The M4 Carbine descends from a family of firearms tracing its lineage back to earlier carbine versions of the M16, all based on the original AR-15 made by ArmaLite. It is a shorter and lighter version of the M16 assault rifle, sharing 80% of its parts. The M4 fires 5.56x45mm NATO ammunition and are gas operated, air cooled, magazine fed, selective fire firearms with a 4 position telescoping stock. As with many carbines, the M4 is handy and more convenient to carry than a full length rifle. It has been adopted by United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) and is the preferred weapon of the U.S. Army Special Forces and Navy SEALs.\n

			The assault rifle was officially unveiled to the public in May 2020. This weapon is intended to replace the Howa Type 89 assault rifle, which has been in service for about 30 years. The new rifle of the Japanese Self-Defense Forces, like the previous one, was developed by Howa Machinery Co, and uses 5.56 mm ammunition. The development of a new rifle to replace the Type 89 began at the request of the Japanese Armed Forces in 2014. Externally and structurally, the new Type 20 rifle is a kind of arithmetic mean of many modern rifles, such as the HK433 or CZ BREN II, and, apparently, does not have any original features. However, there is nothing wrong with this, since it is not the originality of the design that is required from the army weapon, but reliability, low price and compliance with the customer's requirements. It remains a mystery how and in what quantity this rifle came to the participants of a scientific expedition to the Zone.\n

Apart from several minor production improvements, the rifle also features a new foldable synthetic stock made from a black, glass-filled polyamide. The AK-74M also uses a reinforced muzzle device and dust cover. Each AK-74M is fitted with a side-rail bracket for mounting optics. The AK-74M has been accepted as the new service rifle of the Russian Federation\n

			This lightweight AK-74M was tailored to the harsh conditions of the Zone. While the modifications applied to this weapon improve its performance in combat, they also prevent the user from mounting a grenade launcher onto it. It is made at Skadovsk and Yanov Station, from where it disperses throughout the Zone.\n

			The AKM is a 7.62x39mm assault rifle designed by Mikhail Kalashnikov. It is an improved version of the AK-47 rifle and was developed in the 1950's. Introduced to the Red Army in 1959, the AKM is the most ubiquitous variant of the AK series of firearms and it has found widespread use with the former Warsaw Pact states and its many African and Asian allies. The production of AKM rifles was carried out at the Tula Arsenal and Izhevsk Mechanical Works.\n

Nikonov design delays the force of recoil until the fired rounds have left the barrel, which along with a unique 1800 rpm two-shot burst function increases body armour piercing capabilities of this firearm.

The AS-VAL is a gas operated, integrally suppressed weapon. The receiver is machined from steel forging for improved strength. It has a standard side-mounted rail for optical, night vision or red dot scopes but has no provision for mounting a bayonet or a grenade launcher. The integral suppressor could be easily detached for maintenance, repair, or compact storage, but the rifle should not be fired with the suppressor removed due to safety and reliability issues.\n

			The MP-133 is a product of the Izhevsk Mechanical Plant. This shotgun is an evolution of the earlier IZh-81 pump action shotgun, and is intended for civilian and security markets. It is produced in two basic versions: standard MP-133 with tubular magazine and MP-133K with detachable box magazine, both versions can be in various barrel lengths and styles, wood or polymer furniture, fixed or side folding polymer stock or pistol grip only. The MP-133 shotgun uses traditional pump action with sliding hand-guard that has dual action bars. Locking is achieved by a tilting locking piece, installed in the bolt and engages the notch in the barrel extension when in battery. Feed is from tubular underbarrel magazine that holds 4 rounds, though capacity can be enhanced by installing magazine extension tubes.\n

The VSS is quite popular for its stealthy capabilities and the great lethality of the heavy 9x39mm bullets. The effective range of the VSS is limited to 300-400 metres. Featuring the standard dovetail mounting system, it usually accommodates the PSO-1M2-1 scope. Any other scope or night vision sight can be mounted on the appropriate mount. Backup iron sights consist of tangent rear and blade front. The rear sight is graduated for up to 400 metres.\n

			Mercenaries have often worked with scientists as guards. A few years ago, a group of Mercenaries by the name of "The Syndicate" made a deal with the scientist under the lead of Professor Sakhorov, to obtain a set of experimental VSS Vintorez rifles. Some of the rifle's components were manufactured using artifacts from gravitational anomalies. As a result, these components are more durable, while simultaneously being slightly lighter.\n

			This model was developed on the basis of the well-known and well-established VSS Vintorez. One of the main differences from the original is the presence of a special mechanism that allows you to fire in bursts of two bullets and a picatinny rail installed along the entire length of the weapon. This weapon is a really rare sight in The Zone. It was only used by ISG soldiers, or by stalkers who looted the rifle off of their dead bodies.\n

		An unknown weapon, the firing mechanism of which has not been established. The weapon appears faulty - squeezing the trigger doesn't do anything. It's very heavy and definitely high-tech. Of note is that it appears not to fire bullets based on ignition. Most probably, the rounds are propelled by electro-magnetic forces. One can only suspect what kind of destructive potential it possesses.

			The RPG-7 is a further development of the previous RPG-2 anti-tank grenade launcher. The RPG-7, in its first version, known as RPG-7V, has been adopted by the Soviet army in 1961, and is still fielded in Russia and at least 50 more countries. By far, RPG-7 can be considered as one of the most successful anti-tank grenade launchers ever made. Initially thought of as an anti-armour weapon, it was later adopted for other fire support missions with the introduction of other types of grenades, such as anti-infantry HE-FRAG and multi-purpose Thermobaric/FAE. The RPG-7 is a shoulder fired, single shot, smoothbore recoilless launcher, grenades are loaded from the front, and the rear of the barrel is fitted with venturi nozzle. Due to the recoilless design, the backblast is dangerous. The RPG-7 is usually issued with 2.7X fixed magnification optical sight, designated PGO-7. It is a simple and inexpensive, but possess a high threat to modern tanks and can also serve in a number of other roles, making it a flexible weapon.\n
