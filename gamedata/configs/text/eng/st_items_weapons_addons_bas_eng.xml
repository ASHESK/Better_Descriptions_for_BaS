			PSO (for Pritsel Snaipersky Optichesky, "Optical Sniper Sight") is a series of Soviet-made optical scopes produced by Novosibirsk Instrument-Making Plant (NPZ Optics State Plant). In common use since 1964 when it was introduced as a standard issue telescopic sight for SVD sniper rifle. The scope has been later adapted to assault rifles such as AK-74 or AN-94. Recognized for its durability, versatility and very well-designed reticule pattern featuring convenient range-finder scale. This particular type has 4.0x magnification rate, making it usable mainly for combat at long ranges. It is attached to weapons by means of a dovetail mount, which is standard in Warsaw Pact countries.\n

			The Kobra sight is an open collimator combat optic using a laser generated HUD to superimpose a reticle pattern onto a filtered lens. It is designed for engaging fast moving targets and targets appearing for a short period of time in close quarters and urban combat in various light conditions. It provides clear targeting from 104 lx to 10-2 lx (daylight, twilight and moonlight), one or two eye targeting. Effective when shooting from moving vehicles.\n

			The Cobra sight provides confident aiming in natural light conditions (bright sunny day, deep twilight and moonlit night) due to the presence of 16 levels of manual brightness adjustment of the aiming mark. The location of the aiming mark and target in the same plane allows for aiming with both one and two eyes, which creates an unlimited field of view for the shooter, and conduct effective high-speed shooting at quickly moving, small and suddenly appearing for a short time targets.\n

			The original design can be used under any conditions, and also, if necessary, allows the use of a standard mechanical device. The main feature of the sight is the mount of the reflector without a mechanical frame, covering an appreciable part of the firing sector. Reflector protection in extreme conditions is provided by a thin and durable metal visor, which practically does not interfere with firing.\n

			The SpecterDR 4x/1x Dual Role Optical Sight represents a revolution in optical sight design. The world’s first truly dual field of view combat optical sight, the SpecterDR switches instantly from a 4x magnified sight to a 1x CQB sight with the throw of a lever. Unlike zoom sights, the SpecterDR offers an optimized optical path and identical eye relief in both 4x and 1x modes.
			Depending upon the situation, the user may adjust the sight to illuminate the crosshair or just a brilliant red dot in the center. In 1x mode, the SpecterDR has by far the largest field of view in the industry. In 4x mode the SpecterDR offers a generous field of view, long eye relief, and ELCAN’S legendary crystal clear image.
			The SpecterDR 4x/1x offers the best single solution for both Medium Range and CQB engagements and is designed to withstand the rigors of modern professional use. (The scope has back up iron sights on top of it).\n

			Docter as a brand was born in 1991, but the company started writing its story much earlier. It was previously called Carl Zeiss Jena. In the 1980s, this was one of the largest optics manufacturing companies in the world. They started operating more than 100 years ago and built an impeccable reputation throughout the years. After World War II, the company started growing rapidly and bloomed until East and West Germany merged in 1991. This was when the first major change happened – the company was taken over by Bernhard Docter. Shockingly, the company bankrupted. Analytic Jena Group bought Docter in 1997, and the company started growing again. In 2018, a change in administration occurred. The company was renamed from Docter to Noblex. Most of the products remained in the offer but Noblex added some new ones as well. They retained the famous logo – the owl.
			Throughout the years, Docter has been known to offer high-quality Made-in-Germany products for an affordable price. Because of that, the company gathered plenty of followers, loyal to the brand. Since 2018, when Noblex took over, the company expanded their manufacturing processes elsewhere.\n

			From close quarters to long range target engagements, the Leupold Mark 8 CQBSS 1.1-8x24mm incorporates everything Military, Law Enforcement and Competition shooters need into one extremely versatile riflescope. The illuminated front focal plane reticles provide accurate range estimation throughout the entire zoom range. Eight brightness settings ensure optimal visibility of the illuminated reticle in all lighting conditions and are compatible with night vision devices. An off position between each numbered brightness setting ensures long battery life and nearly instant return to the desired reticle intensity.\n

			Kobra Military 8-18 Red Dot Weaver Rifle Scope, Screw Mount. The world famous Kobra is an open collimator "red dot" combat optic using laser-generated "heads-up display" (HUD) technology to superimpose a reticle pattern onto a filtered lens which acts as an aiming device for the shooter. This system presents an unobstructed field of view, in 1x power which allows for extremely comfortable, "both eyes open" shooting. On average, most users will see a 1.5 times faster target acquisition and a 50% smaller shot group at 100 meters, in comparison to the iron sights. It is designed for engaging fast moving targets and targets appearing for a short period of time in close quarters and urban combat situations in various light conditions. It provides clear targeting from 104 lx to 10-2 lx (daylight, twilight and moonlight), one- or two-eye targeting, is very effective when shooting from moving vehicles, and allows for perfect kill shots on fast-moving, small and spontaneously appearing targets.\n
